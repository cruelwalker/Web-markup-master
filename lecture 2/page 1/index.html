	    Worlds 2018 Qualification Guide
	 </h2>
     
     <p>
        The 2018 League of Legends World Championship kicks off on October 1, 2018. That’s less than a month from today!
         With fourteen regions competing in the tournament, it can be tough to keep track of how seeds are allocated and	
		 which teams fill those seeds. Not to worry, we’ve got you covered - read on for an explanation of all things Worlds qualification.
	 </p>
     <p>	 
        How are seeds allocated?
	 </p>
     <p>	 
        A region’s seeds are based on past international performance. Consistently strong regions send some or all of their seeds 
		straight to the Group Stage, whereas other regions receive fewer seeds and/or start in the Play-In Stage.
     
        For Korea’s League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK), three seeds are sent to the Group Stage.                    

        In the following regions, the top two seeds are sent to the Group Stage and the third seed is sent to the Play-In Stage:

        China – League of Legends Pro League (LPL)
        Europe – European League of Legends Championship Series (EU LCS)
        North America – North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS)
        Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau – League of Legends Master Series (LMS)
        In the following regions, one seed is sent to the Play-In Stage:
     </p>
        <ul>
		    <li>
			Brazil – Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends (CBLoL)
			</li>
            <li>
			Commonwealth of Independent States – The League of Legends Continental League (LCL)
			</li>
			<li>
			Japan – League of Legends Japan League (LJL)
			</li>
			<li>
			Latin America North – Liga Latinoamérica Norte (LLN)
			</li>
			<li>
			Latin America South – Copa Latinoamérica Sur (CLS)
			</li>
			<li>
			Oceania – Oceanic Pro League (OPL)
			</li>
			<li>
			Turkey – Turkish Championship League (TCL)
			</li>
			<li>
			Southeast Asia - SEA Tour (SEA)
			</li>
			<li>
			Vietnam - Vietnam Championship Series (VCS)
			</li>
        
     <p>
      *The highest-ranking of these regions at MSI advances directly to the Group Stage. For 2018, that region is the VCS.
